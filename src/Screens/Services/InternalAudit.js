              The existing business and corporate environment has conclusively
              proved that the Internal Audit function has attained much more
              significance than the conventional transaction-based role of the
              past. In order to survive in a technology-driven society, business
              entities must be responsive in order to achieve targets in
              identifying opportunities, managing risks and exposures that can
              determine success or failure. This practice segment provides
              services in enhancing the scope and approach of the existing
              internal audit function of clients by providing advice,
              re-engineering and coordinating the internal audit department. The
              firm is well equipped and staffed to undertake Internal Audit
              Function on a fully outsourced basis.

                  business objectives and corporate mission.

                  accept; and to identify and focus on the opportunities
                  available.
